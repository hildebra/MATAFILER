1.4.2 (12/4/2014)
- FIxed a bug that cannot recruit reads for reassembly.
- Added sections instructing users to download and install auxiliary software packages if autobuild_auxiliary fails.

1.4.1 (11/21/2014)
- FIxed a bug that crashes MaxBin when sequences with all 'N's are ecountered.

1.4 (10/8/2014)
- Added -marketset option to choose between 107 marker genes and 40 marker genes sets. 40 marker genes are more suitale for extreme environments that dominated by Archaea while 107 marker genes are suitable for more general cases. Default is 107 marker genes.
- Added -reassembly parameters for recruiting reads and then reassemble individual bins. This feature is still highly experimental. Feedbacks are more than welcomed.
- Added Velvet as another mandatory auxiliary software package.
- Due to the newly-released FragGeneScan 1.19 (which I helped to develop) that supports multi-thread function, MaxBin will now attempt to run FragGeneScan in multi-thread mode.

1.3 (5/12/2014)
- Fixed bugs relating having 100+ bins.
- Cleaned up the log file.
- Added the -max_iteration option to adjust the maximum number of EM runs (default 50).
- Unclassified sequences and sequences shorter than minimum length threshold are now stored in different files (.tooshort and .noclass).

1.2.1 (3/14/2014)
- Added support for the FASTQ format when the -reads option is specified.

1.2 (1/27/2014)
- Stabalized the connection between MaxBin and auxiliary software packages.
- Added the function to check the output of auxiliary software packages. MaxBin will now output warning messages and stop running when there are errors.
- Bug fixes.

1.1 (10/15/2013)
- Fixed the bug that crashes the program when a fasta file with a long single line is encountered.
- Implemented recursive binning, in which binned fasta files will be checked separately for further binning possibilities.
- Make the summary file more informative by adding Completeness (i.e. how complete the binned genomes are), Genome sizes and GC content.
- Sort the bins by descending order of their abundance levels.
- Add total number of marker genes and the number of unique marker genes into 2nd and 3rd column of the .marker file.
- Add a function to automatically "switch" to more powerful binning mode once MaxBin finds that it cannot find enough marker genes to determine bin number.

1.0.1 (6/25/2013)
- Added -min_contig_len parameter for users to decide the minimum contig length acceptable in MaxBin. Default value of minimum contig length is 1000.
- Added -plotmarker option and integrated it with R (Rscript) to plot the marker gene heatmap as PDF file.
- Added -verbose option for debug usage.
- Fix bug when the coverage of certain contig is 0. This should not happen very often, but codes are added to avoid program crash on such circumstance.

1.0  (4/29/2013)
- Integrated core MaxBin algorithm into perl script to connect with 3rd-party software.
- Added compile_MaxBin script for users to compile MaxBin core program and all 3rd-party software.
